**Prompt:**

You are an AI web developer. Your task is to create a **fully responsive landing page** for a fictional startup called *CloudZephyr*, which provides cloud-based solutions. The page should:

1. **Structure & Layout**:
   - A **full-screen hero section** with a background image and a clear headline.
   - A **features section** with at least three feature cards or columns, each with an icon and description.
   - A **prominent CTA (Call to Action)** button near the top.
   - A **footer** including basic contact info and social media links.

2. **Visual & Style**:
   - Dark or light theme is acceptable, but keep it modern and minimal.
   - May use a free CSS library (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap) **or** purely inline/embedded CSS.
   - Ensure the layout is **responsive** for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

3. **Implementation**:
   - **Single HTML File** containing all necessary code (HTML, CSS, and minimal JS if needed).
   - Use semantic HTML elements and provide `alt` text for images.
   - The final result should work by simply opening the `.html` file in a browserâ€”no extra files.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Employ semantic tags and proper labeling.
