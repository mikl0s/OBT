**Prompt:**

You are an AI coder. Your task is to write a **single Python file** that implements a command-line Sudoku game. The program must:

1. **Generate** a new Sudoku puzzle at three difficulty levels: *Easy, Medium, Hard*.  
2. **Display** the puzzle in a user-friendly grid format on the command line.  
3. **Allow** the user to enter a row, column, and value to place a number.  
4. **Check** if the puzzle is solved correctly.  
5. **Validate** moves (no duplicates in rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids).  
6. **Optional**: Include a “hint” feature that fills in one correct cell if requested.  
7. **Single File Constraint**:
   - All code must be contained in **one** `.py` file.
   - Use only standard Python libraries (no Sudoku-specific external libs).
