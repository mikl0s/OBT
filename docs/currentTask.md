# Current Task Status

## Completed
- Set up project documentation structure
- Created MongoDB configuration with Podman
- Implemented backend framework with FastAPI
- Created data models for hardware and test information
- Implemented hardware information collection service
- Set up API endpoints structure
- Added WebSocket support for test progress updates
- Added Ollama integration with reasoning extraction
- Implemented dynamic prompt loading from prompts directory
- Created default test prompts:
  - writing500words.md
  - codingSudoko.md
  - codingLandingpage.md
- Implemented comprehensive benchmarking suite
- Added hardware-aware testing with CPU/GPU support
- Added detailed performance metrics tracking
- Implemented pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Updated linting configurations for frontend and backend
- Fixed exception handling and code style issues
- Fixed backend server import errors related to hardware models
- Implemented client registration tracking with unique UUIDs
- Separated hardware info collection from heartbeat mechanism
- Added client registration time tracking
- Updated frontend to handle hardware info correctly
- Improved error handling in client-server communication

## Current Objectives
- Set up frontend framework with SvelteKit
- Create initial UI components
- Implement model selection interface
- Add prompt selection functionality
- Tag release v0.3.2 with latest improvements
- Document all changes in release notes
- Ensure all tests pass with new registration system

## Next Steps
1. Frontend Development
   - Initialize SvelteKit project
   - Set up Tailwind CSS and Flowbite-Svelte
   - Create base UI components
   - Implement model selection page
   - Add prompt selection interface

2. Backend Integration
   - Complete test execution engine
   - Add real-time progress updates via WebSocket
   - Implement result storage in MongoDB

3. Testing
   - Write unit tests for backend services
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints
   - Set up end-to-end testing with Playwright

4. Test the new client registration system thoroughly
5. Update client documentation with registration ID usage
6. Consider adding registration ID to benchmark results
7. Plan future improvements for client session management

## Context
- Backend structure is in place with FastAPI
- MongoDB is configured with Podman
- Hardware information collection is implemented
- API endpoints structure is ready for frontend integration
- Test prompts are managed through markdown files
- Ollama integration supports reasoning extraction

## Notes
- Focus on creating a clean, modern UI with dark theme
- Ensure real-time updates work smoothly
- Keep documentation updated as we progress
- Allow users to easily add/remove test prompts

## Technical Notes
- Client registration now includes:
  - Unique UUID for session tracking
  - Hardware information collection
  - Registration timestamp
- Heartbeat mechanism remains lightweight
- Hardware info is stored once per registration
- All client operations can be traced to specific registration sessions
