# Ollama Benchmark Tool (OBT) Project Roadmap

## Project Goals
- Create a web application for benchmarking Ollama models across different hardware configurations
- Provide insights into model performance and system resource usage
- Enable easy comparison of test results across different environments

## Key Features
- [ ] Local Ollama Integration (Windows & Linux)
- [ ] Model Discovery and Selection
- [ ] Hardware Information Collection
- [ ] Automated Performance Testing
- [ ] Test Results Storage (MongoDB)
- [ ] Modern Dark-themed Dashboard
- [ ] Search and Filter Functionality

## Completion Criteria
1. Application successfully runs on both Windows and Linux
2. Can discover and test local Ollama models
3. Stores all test data in MongoDB
4. Provides searchable dashboard interface
5. Documentation is complete and accurate
